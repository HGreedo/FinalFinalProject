        <p>The inspiration behind OFBC, is largely attributed to the work Acronym was doing in the early 2000’s dot com era – where as an up and coming apparel brand, they created a private, “invite-only” wholesale site to help logistically plan manufacturing and sales to retail clients. 

    <br></br>
    <br></br>
The purpose of the OFBC is to circumvent the notion and aged-trend of a partaking in Trade Shows – why? Because as a small apparel brand, intellectual property is everything, and larger brands often use trade shows to scope out talent as well as undercut other brand’s ideas. Larger brands can create garments more efficiently than smaller, local brands. 
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
The second purpose is to reconnect people in a post-pandemic world. And, to show local boutiques and their customers that there is more to Oregon’s fashion and apparel scene than the Big 4 (Nike, Adidas, Columbia, Under Armour). Portland has such a long-tenured history of supporting and shopping local – OFBC encourages all to prioritize a ‘local-first’ mindset.
